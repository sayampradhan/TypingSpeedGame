# TypingSpeedGame

The SpeedTypingTest is a speed typing test game that allows you to measure your typing speed. This game is made in Python using the `curses` library for the console-based user interface.

## Description

This game loads a random line of text from a text file, presents it to the user, and measures the words per minute (WPM) typing speed. Correct characters are highlighted in green, while incorrect ones are highlighted in red.

## Installation

To use the SpeedTypingTest, you need to have Python installed. This game was developed using Python 3.7 but should work on other Python 3 versions. 

```
git clone https://github.com/sayampradhan/SpeedTypingTest.git
cd SpeedTypingTest
```

## Usage

In order to run the game, use the following command:

```
python main.py
```

After you start the game, you will see a welcome screen. Press any key to begin the test. Your objective is to type out the provided text as quickly and accurately as possible. Your current typing speed in WPM will be displayed on the screen.
